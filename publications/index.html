    <p>With increasing urban population, there is global interest in Urban Air Mobility (UAM), where hundreds of autonomous Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) execute missions in the airspace above cities. Unlike traditional human-in-the-loop air traffic management, UAM requires decentralized autonomous approaches that scale for an order of magnitude higher aircraft densities and are applicable to urban settings. We present Learning-to-Fly (L2F), a decentralized on-demand airborne collision avoidance framework for multiple UAS that allows them to independently plan and safely execute missions with spatial, temporal and reactive objectives expressed using Signal Temporal Logic. We formulate the problem of predictively avoiding collisions between two UAS without violating mission objectives as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). This however is intractable to solve online. Instead we develop L2F, a two-stage collision avoidance method that consists of: 1)a learning-based decision making scheme and 2) a distributed, linear programming-based UAS control algorithm. Through extensive simulations, we show the real-time applicability of our method which is ≈ 6000× faster than the MILP approach and can resolve 99.4% of collisions when there is ample room to maneuver, and shows graceful degradation in performance otherwise. We also compare L2F to two other methods and demonstrate an implementation on quad-rotor robots.</p>

    <p>Medical cyber-physical systems, such as the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), require evaluation of safety and efficacy in the context of a patient population in a clinical trial. Advances in computer modeling and simulation allow for generation of a simulated cohort or virtual cohort which mimics a patient population and can be used as a source of prior information. A major obstacle to acceptance of simulation results as a source of prior information is the lack of a framework for explicitly modeling sources of uncertainty in simulation results and quantifying the effect on trial outcomes.
In this work, we formulate the Computer-Aided Clinical Trial (CACT) within a Bayesian statistical framework allowing explicit modeling of assumptions and utilization of simulation results at all stages of a clinical trial. To quantify the robustness of the CACT outcome with respect to a simulation assumption, we define δ-robustness as the minimum perturbation of the base prior distribution resulting in a change of the CACT outcome and provide a method to estimate the δ-robustness.
We demonstrate the utility of the framework and how the results of δ-robustness evaluation can be utilized at various stages of a clinical trial through an application to the Rhythm ID Goes Head-to-head Trial (RIGHT), which was a comparative evaluation of the safety and efficacy of specific software algorithms across different implantable cardiac devices. Finally, we introduce a hardware interface that allows for direct interaction with the physical device in order to validate and confirm the results of a CACT for implantable cardiac devices.</p>

    <p>The ability of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles(aUAVs)   to   carry   out   a   diverse   range   of   missions   presentsenormous  societal  and  economic  benefits.  However,  one  criticalsafety  issue  that  must  be  addressed  prior  to  large-scale  aUAVadoption is the potential for aUAV-on-aUAV trajectory conflicts.Current  decentralized  methods  for  trajectory  conflict  resolutionare  energy  and  resource  intensive,  rendering  them  difficult  toscale and implement. We propose a centralized, infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) approach that leverages modular embedded systems(“control  modules”).  A  voxel-based  airspace  reservation  systemis  maintained  by  the  control  module,  which  interrogates  andretrieves  the  stored  trajectories  from  aUAVs  approaching  thereservation   airspace.   Trajectory conflict search   is   performed by  the  control  module,  and  conflict  resolution  protocols  aretransmitted  back  to  the  aUAVs.  Our  communication  protocolis  Wi-Fi-based  and  leverages  a  lightweight  on-board  ODROIDmicrocontroller;   the   setup   is   agnostic   to   the   specific   aUAVplatform  and  firmware.  We  simulate  various  airspace  situationsand test the resiliency of our reservation system in MATLAB. Wealso leverage two aUAV testbeds to demonstrate the performanceof  our  centralized  air  traffic  control  regime.</p>

    <p>The problem of safe planning and control for multi- drone systems across a variety of missions is of critical impor- tance, as the scope of tasks assigned to such systems increases. In this paper, we present an approach to solve this problem for multi-quadrotor missions. Given a mission expressed in Signal Temporal Logic (STL), our controller maximizes robustness to generate trajectories for the quadrotors that satisfy the STL spec- ification in continuous-time. We also show that the constraints on our optimization guarantees that these trajectories can be tracked nearly perfectly by lower level off-the-shelf position and attitude controllers. Our approach avoids the oversimplifying abstractions found in many planning methods, while retaining the expressiveness of missions encoded in STL allowing us to handle complex spatial, temporal and reactive requirements. Through experiments, both in simulation and on actual quadrotors, we show the performance, scalability and real-time applicability of our method.</p>
